# kitaev models VQE
VQE implementation for the Kitaev model using Majorana fermions.

## Dependencies: 
    1. numpy 
    2. scipy 
    3. networkx 
    4. qiskit

## Running the code
To run the code you can either run: 

    * "constant_gauge_vqe.py" which can only deal with pure Kitaev model case. 
    
    * "msvqe.py" which can deal with pure Kiteav model + magnetic fields.

# kitaev models VQE
VQE implementation for the Kitaev model using Majorana fermions.
To run the code you need to run the vqe_setup.py file

# Things to add 
1. Compare ground state overlap not just ground state energy 
2. Try adding fields in the 4 qubit case where you can still run statevector simulator.
